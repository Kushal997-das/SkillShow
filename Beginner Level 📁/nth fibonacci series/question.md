# Problem Description

You are given a number `n` as an argument. You have to implement the function `findFibonacci` which will find the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is given by 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,... where 0 and 1 are the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers respectively, and every consecutive number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.

**Hint:** Use a loop to iterate and compute the nth Fibonacci number. Think about the condition where the loop should end.

**Explanation:**
The Fibonacci series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, … The second number of the Fibonacci series is 1.

## Sample Input 2

```plaintext
4
```

## Sample Output 2

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**
The Fibonacci series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, … The fourth number of the Fibonacci series is 3.
