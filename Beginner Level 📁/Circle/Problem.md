# Problem Description
Aryan is a small kid, and the circle is his favorite shape. Whenever he gets a number, he tries to find the area of a circle whose radius is that given number.

You are given a number `r` as an argument denoting the radius of the circle. You need to implement the function `findAreaOfCircle` which will return a number equal to the area of the circle with radius `r`. Given radius is always greater than 0.

**Hint 1:** The area of a circle is calculated using the formula: `Area = Ï€ * r * r` (where `r` is the radius of the circle).

**Hint 2:** Use `Math.PI` to get the value of pi.


## Sample Input
```plaintext
3
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
28.274333882308138
```

**Explanation:**
Area of the circle = `Math.PI * 3 * 3 = 28.274333882308138`
