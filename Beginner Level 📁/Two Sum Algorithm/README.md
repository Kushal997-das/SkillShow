# Problem Statement: Two Sum

## Problem Description
You are given an array of integers, `nums`, and an integer `target`. Your task is to find two indices of numbers in the array such that they add up to the `target`. 

Return the indices of these two numbers in any order.

### Constraints
1. Each input will have **exactly one solution**.
2. You may **not use the same element twice**.
3. You can return the result in **any order**.

### Input
- `nums`: An array of integers.
- `target`: An integer representing the target sum.

### Output
- An array containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to `target`.
