### Two Sum Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, find two numbers in the array that add up to target. Return the indices of these two numbers as a pair. Each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example

# Input:
  nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
  target = 9
  
# Output:
  [0, 1]
  
# Explanation:
  nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].

## Constraints

   -  The solution will always exist in the input.
   -  2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
   -   -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
   -   -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
