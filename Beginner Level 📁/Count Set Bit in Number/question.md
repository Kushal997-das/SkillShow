## Problem Statement
Write a Java program to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a given non-negative integer.

### Input
- A single integer `n` where `0 <= n <= 10^9`.

### Output
- The number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of the integer.

### Example

#### Example 1:
**Input**:  
`5`

**Output**:  
`2`

**Explanation**:  
Binary representation of 5 is `101`, which has 2 set bits.

#### Example 2:
**Input**:  
`10`

**Output**:  
`2`

**Explanation**:  
Binary representation of 10 is `1010`, which has 2 set bits.

#### Example 3:
**Input**:  
`0`

**Output**:  
`0`

**Explanation**:  
Binary representation of 0 is `0`, which has no set bits.

### Constraints
- `0 <= n <= 10^9`
