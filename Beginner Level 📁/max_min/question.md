# Problem Description

You are given an array of numbers `arr` as an argument. You need to implement the function `maxMinDifference` which will return a number denoting the difference between the maximum and minimum element of the array. The length of the array is at least 1 and all the elements are greater than 0.

**Hint 1:** We can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` to calculate the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

**Hint 2:** Traverse the complete array and keep two variables to get the minimum and maximum element and finally return their difference.

**Hint 3:** Documentation of `Math.min`: [Math.min - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min)

**Hint 4:** Documentation of `Math.max`: [Math.max - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max)

**Hint 5:** Documentation of `All common math function` : [All common math function](https://kushaldas.hashnode.dev/javascriptmathfunction#heading-common-math-functions)

## Sample Input
```plaintext
7, 3, 8, 4
```

## Sample Output
```plaintext
5
```

**Explanation:**
The maximum element in the array is 8, and the minimum element is 3. The difference of 8 and 3 is 5.
