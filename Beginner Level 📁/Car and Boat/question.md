## Problem Statement

Implement two classes: `Car` and `Boat` to handle different types of vehicles and return a formatted string describing their maximum speed.

### Input
- `Car` constructor: Takes two arguments — maximum speed and the unit (either "km/h" or "mph").
- `Boat` constructor: Takes one argument — maximum speed in knots.
